#### SCENARIO:
- ABC Is a newly established company into the business of manufacturing and selling laptops
- They sells only to corporates manufacture of laptops is over
- sales and marketing has not yet started
- They are looking for sales and marketing team that can suggest them a suitable sales and marketing process
- you are one of the shortlisted teams
- You are Required to propose a sales and marketing process to them and based on process you recommend ,you will be hired.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Suppose there are 10k laptops that are already manufactured
- These laptops are products that are manufactured or produced(there can be different modles and variations avaialble)like 2000 laps with one features and other 4000  will be with another features
- These information needs to be tracked
- Like pricing is different crm also need the information needs to be tarcked
- All the products that you are manufactured that needs to be store in one thing, so it is stored in products
- Goto sales application and understand all tabs in it and how data got transfered from one tab to another tab
### Products
- sales->products->new product
- <img width="437" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-23 120242" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72751737/227122365-04c91813-3809-4f23-8b2d-ef2b73e45c7e.png">
- Here product name and product family like is it tab or laptop like this
- Every company has different way of tracking details and different arrtributes like laptops,shoes
- product active means any product which is avaiable for sales
- inactive means it is not avaiable
- some of the models are outdated and company stops manufacturing it
------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Campaigns
- upto know you have tracked all product things now what you need to do is you need to start promotions
- Promotional Events or Activities
- promotions can be send in many ways it can be send through emails,you can make phone calls,put it on websites,companies do demonstartions,conducts seminars what     ever put a newspaper add,mazine add all these are prmotional activites
- All these promotional activites you are trying to do needs to be tracked
- So,in sales there is a campaigns tab and there is a campaign object in backend all those promotion activities are tarcked in backend
- let suppose you are doing a conference
- Active Campaign is something which is still active
- Those you not doing are inactive campaigns

- There different types of promotional activities telemarketing,email
- Next there is status whether it is a planned or in progress 
- There will be start date and stop date
<img width="436" alt="1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72751737/227144501-18c63d8e-a921-4972-8bfc-2186db4c7357.png">
- Expected revenue and Budgeted cost
- Actual Cost
- So,After a Campaign you will receive a few intrested prosperties
- During this conference people receive few enquiries that people saying we are intrested.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Leads
- Suppose we had sadhana who shoes intrest in our product
- She works for a company called wipro is sales manager
- The guy who shows intrest i need to track his intrest as well
- So this will be tracked under leads
- So all intrested people should need to track under  leads
- and you can track with campagin from which campagin the leading is coming
- So you can understand how many leads have you generated from the particular campaign
- So that is the reason associate a lead with campaign but make sure that campaign is active
- Only active campaigns can be connected to the leads

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Lead Conversion
- Every one wants laptop if you want laptop talk to our procuretment Head who is Ramakrishna
- More over if you go and create one more lead because if you go and create one more lead then both you should be individual but what i want both of them to be          linked under 1 account
<img width="427" alt="3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72751737/227145591-a857e376-31b5-41a5-ba5c-94f6f459411a.png">


- I need to have to delete the first person but i also need to store the information of second person and we cannot delete the information of the first person and       without deleting i need to store information of the second person
- More over i can't create one more lead because if i create 1 more lead  what 1 want is both of them one account to be linked becuase both of them are from wipro
- So,in that case what you need to do is you can conver this lead into account and contacts
- so on lead once you save the lead there is a convert button
- Select the Converted status and try to convert
- Converting Basically means it will convert the lead into the account,contact 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ### Accounts and Contacts
- Account will have the company information related wipro ,contacts will have the information of persons who are working
- All the leads you are getting will not be the valid leads some them are not valid at all
- The moment you try to call them is the phone number is wrong
- when you do this events lot of people will keep wrong phone number and wrong mail id
- So,Once the lead is validated then only they  can convert the account and contacts
- However as a company you can decide to keep in the directly in accounts and contacts
- No that will result in useless kind of data ib accounts and contacts
- when convert the wipro company related information will go to account and individual related information will go into contact click on convert button
- This convert button is standard functionality so it will go head and create the account and contact it also asks you whether you want to create opportunity or not
- when you click on account,contact then you also check for the opportunity or not
      accounts-company
      Contacts-Individuals

 
- will not track the information related to  your deal also 
- what is the prospect or what is the opportunity that you have
- like if you had the opportunity of selling 200 Laptops in nov where this info will store this info is also mixed with  the opportunity
- while converting the lead you can convert into account,contacts and opportunity
- you can select to uncheck the opportunity
- After converting you can add the contact ramakrishna in contact tab so
- You the option of storing the more information
- You can to opportunity and create that simply go to account and under the account you scroll down a little 
- Create a new opportunity from here or simply you can go to the opportunity tab and create
- Opportunity name as 200 laptops for wipro and account name is wipro,trigger this account name and what is the amount that you are expecting
- close date of the opportunity then opportunity also have the option of stages becuase why stages opportunity will go for several stages
- Either the opportunity will have one opportunity or the lost opportunity
- opportunity will have a complete life cycle either starts or proceed and differnt value proposition ,like ID decision makers etc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Contracts

- forecasts,reports and dashboard are used for analysis purpose(we will talk it in analytics part)
- let say if you have one opportunity then you have one contracts
- There is a contract object it is like an agreement so there is a object to track all the contracts
- contract is just like agreement
- once there is an agreemnt there is also orders associated to it
- Account name,order start date,conract number and put all other details
- orders can be tracked in orders tab and casesis like customer will come backs to you with cases that will be tracked by cases
- In cases you can declare all like its high priority complaint
- It is a generic application that salesforce had designed 
- Some of the companies will also have invoice object every comapnies will be different
- so upto know we understand upto sales application whihc is prebuild thing
---------------------------------------------------------------
### Quote management:

- suppose the customer xyz private limited and the contact person name is joo
- jo says hey rajesh you are the sales person send me the quotation

- i know you are charging me 182 dollars so can you send me the quotation i want to see after taxes,all the var ,gst and local var what will be the final amount that you want to charge so for that we had something called quotation

<img width="435" alt="4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72751737/227146522-97d6dc0c-fc1d-42cb-ab2b-404ad1fdb858.png">

- so,you as an admin need to enable for quotation for first time

##### Enable quotation:

-- go to =>setup=>search for quote setting=>enable it
- if you and check in opportunities for quote tab there is not quote there 
- notes and attachement are like if you want to attach there
- contact roles for under particular account how many contacts are there
- partners are like this xyz company is partner to another company like abc private lmited and this abc private limited is account
- stage executive is also very important initially the stage was qualification,then it changed to negotiation and prospecting nd so and so
- This quote was not visible before i enabled it
- once admin will enable it is coming know
<img width="458" alt="5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72751737/227147146-7476fecb-6057-4e73-8bad-4440f664269c.png">

- now you can say to jo let me send the quotation
- Quote is the standard object given by salesforce
- Every quote should have expiry date
- so,now i create the quote now i need to send it
- in quote also there will be different status needs review,in review,approved,rejected,presented,accepted,denied

- To Change the status of button

- Within salesforce the sales person can acutally email the code
- how?
- goto quote tab and create new pdf  and the view will be like this
- Give logo and all the things once you are done save and send as Email 
- after that it ask from to whom you need to send the email
- and Then she will receive the quote through mail like this
- now if you keep the quote as closed lost then you can keep 
- then there i need one startegy to resell another product 
- so,did need create the opportunity again
- then now i am going to create 2d opporunity now
- so,to resell you  no need  to create lead again you can go to opportunity once you open account you can see there opportunities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Product and PriceBook

- There are two more products called product and price book
- go to sales app=>pencil item=>add price book  and product
##### product:
- it is again the admin job to configure the  product
- if you see the product
- Based on the business needs you need to create the product
- First make sure that is active or not
- as an admin you just need to configure and othr is business responsibilities 
- so,these products don not have a price book  
- Add standard price to the product here you can actually provide the standard price
- some time one product has multiple pricess bases on the wituatin like diwali offers like that
- so all where you need to maintain in pricebook object
- here this is not a standrad price book its a custo, price book
- you can add product from price book
- or you can add price book from product
- opportunity is the object which tracks exactly where the object is
